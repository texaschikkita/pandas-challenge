###**Summary**

**Written Report**

The results were different than I had expected.   It seems that bigger budgets don't equate to bigger scores.  Actually, it was the opposite.  The schools with less money out performed the schools with overall larger budgets.  

Similarily, the schools with more money per student available were outperformed by schools with less money per student.  


When comparing schools by size though,  the results were in-line with what I already presumed.  
Smaller schools did better.    
However, it doesn't show us a complete picture because we don't know if the class sizes were the same or smaller than the larger schools.   
Teacher to student ratio would have been extremely helpful in making a better analysis, but that information was not available.  
The results show that district schools have more students when compared to the charter schools.  
That is not surprising.  We don't know the qualifiers for the charter schools to understand how the student enrollment process is done.  
Without knowing that it's hard to make any assumptions about the quality of education, comparatively. 


The Charter schools performed better, which is not shocking. But, the admissions process wasn't included in the data so it's hard to say why. 
I can only speculate they are more challenging to gain admissions into.
Given that, charter school require an application process, while district school only requisite in living within the zones for the school, this makes sense.
